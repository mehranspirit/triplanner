### User Experience
- **Offline Indicator**: Visual indicator showing connection status and pending sync
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, sync happens in background
- **Storage Management**: View storage usage and pending operations
- **Automatic Sync**: Seamless synchronization when coming back online

## üß™ Testing the Offline Mode

### Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Basic Offline Functionality
1. **Load the app** when online to cache initial data
2. **Go offline** (turn off WiFi or use browser dev tools)
3. **Navigate the app** - trips should still load from cache
4. **Create a new trip** - it should work and be queued for sync
5. **Go back online** - check that new trip syncs to server

#### 2. Using Browser Developer Tools
1. Open **Chrome DevTools** (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Check **"Offline"** to simulate offline mode
4. Test various app functionalities
5. Uncheck to go back online and watch sync process

#### 3. Progressive Web App Testing
1. Visit the app in Chrome/Edge
2. Look for **"Install"** button in address bar
3. Install the app to your desktop/home screen
4. Test offline functionality in the installed app

#### 4. Storage and Sync Testing
1. Go offline and make several changes (create trips, add expenses)
2. Click the **offline indicator** in top-right corner
3. View pending sync operations and storage usage
4. Go online and watch operations sync automatically
5. Test the **"Sync Now"** button

### Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Complete Offline Trip Management
```
1. Go offline
2. Create a new trip with details
3. Add events (flights, hotels, activities)
4. Edit trip notes with formatting
5. Create checklist items
6. Add expenses
7. Go online
8. Verify all data synced correctly
```

#### Scenario 2: Network Interruption
```
1. Start creating a trip while online
2. Disconnect internet during the process
3. Complete the trip creation
4. Reconnect internet
5. Verify the trip syncs properly
```

#### Scenario 3: Conflict Resolution
```
1. Open trip in two browser tabs
2. Go offline in one tab
3. Edit the trip in both tabs differently
4. Go online in the offline tab
5. Verify conflict handling (last write wins)
```

#### Scenario 4: Large Data Sets
```
1. Load app with many trips
2. Go offline
3. Test performance with cached data
4. Add new content
5. Monitor storage usage in offline indicator
```

## üì± Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium 80+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 78+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 80+

### Limited Support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Safari iOS 11.3+ (Service Worker limitations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Chrome Android (some PWA features may vary)

## üîß Developer Testing Tools

### Service Worker Testing
```javascript
// Check if service worker is registered
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  console.log('SW registrations:', registrations);
});

// Test cache
caches.keys().then(cacheNames => {
  console.log('Available caches:', cacheNames);
});
```

### IndexedDB Inspection
1. Open **Chrome DevTools**
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Expand **Storage** ‚Üí **IndexedDB**
4. Inspect `triplanner-offline` database
5. View cached trips, events, expenses, and sync queue

### Network Throttling
1. In DevTools **Network** tab
2. Change throttling from "No throttling" to:
   - Slow 3G
   - Fast 3G
   - Offline
3. Test app performance under different conditions

## üìä Storage Management

### Storage Limits
- **IndexedDB**: ~50% of available disk space per origin
- **Cache API**: Shared with IndexedDB quota
- **Typical usage**: ~1-5MB for most users

### Clearing Storage
```javascript
// Clear all offline data (run in console)
import { offlineService } from './src/services/offlineService';
await offlineService.clearCache();
```

### Monitoring Storage
- Use the **offline indicator** to view real-time storage usage
- Check pending sync operations
- Monitor quota usage with progress bar

## üöÄ Performance Tips

### For Users
1. **Load app online first** to cache essential data
2. **Limit offline operations** to avoid large sync queues
3. **Check storage usage** periodically via offline indicator
4. **Sync manually** if automatic sync seems slow

### For Developers
1. **Optimize bundle size** for faster offline loading
2. **Implement selective caching** for large datasets
3. **Use background sync** for non-critical operations
4. **Monitor service worker lifecycle** in production

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "App not working offline"
- Check if service worker is registered
- Verify initial data was cached when online
- Clear browser cache and reload when online

#### "Sync not happening"
- Check network connectivity indicator
- Try manual sync via offline indicator
- Verify sync queue in IndexedDB

#### "Storage quota exceeded"
- Clear old cached data
- Reduce number of cached trips
- Check for stuck sync operations

#### "PWA not installing"
- Ensure manifest.json is accessible
- Check console for service worker errors
- Verify HTTPS (required for PWA)

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Check network status
console.log('Online:', navigator.onLine);

// Force sync
import { networkAwareApi } from './src/services/networkAwareApi';
await networkAwareApi.forcSync();

// View storage info
await networkAwareApi.getStorageInfo();
```

## üîÑ Sync Behavior

### Automatic Sync Triggers
- App comes back online
- Every 30 seconds when online
- On successful network requests
- On app focus/visibility change

### Sync Queue Management
- Operations retry up to 3 times
- Failed operations are removed after max retries
- Queue processed in FIFO order
- Background sync for API failures

### Conflict Resolution
- **Last write wins** strategy
- Server data overwrites local changes
- User notified of conflicts via offline indicator
- Manual conflict resolution in future versions

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Selective sync for large trips
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Offline map tiles caching
- [ ] Push notifications for sync status
- [ ] Background data refresh
- [ ] Export offline data

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Differential sync (only changed data)
- [ ] Compression for cached data
- [ ] Lazy loading for trip details
- [ ] Service worker optimization

## üéâ Success Metrics
